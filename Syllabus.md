# Syllabus

## Overview

This is the  intermediate Python class.  You know the basics of coding from your
previous CS classes;  now it's time to look at how to solve larger problems, and
how to make your solutions more efficient.  We'll focus on  Python's "container"
types  (`list`, `dict`, and `set`) and how and when to use each one.  We'll also
look at how these types are laid out in memory,  and how that makes them good at
certain jobs  and not others.  You'll also  learn how to apply  this analysis to
entire programs, which is the key to writing efficient code.


## Materials

Everything in this class is optional except the programming assignments  and the
tests.  I don't  take attendance.  There is no  required reading.  Everything we
talk about in this class  is common computer science material,  and you can find
it online in whatever format you like best.

The textbook used in other sections of CS 9 is freely available online:

- **Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python** by Bradley Miller and David Ranum\
  <https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/index.html>


## Grading

Your entire grade comes from programming assignments and tests, weighted as follows:

- **55%** Programming Assignments
- **20%** Midterm Exam
- **25%** Final Exam

There will be  about eight programming assignments - one for each week without a
test - all (roughly) equally weighted. You may turn in any assignment up to five
days late, but at a penalty of ten percent per day.  An assignment due on Monday
can be turned in on Tuesday  for 90% of your Gradescope score,  on Wednesday for
80%, and so on.  It cannot be turned in on Sunday or later.

I may  decide to curve the class;  if I do,  this will apply to  your cumulative
scores at the end of the quarter, and will only be in your favor. Getting 90% of
the possible points guarantees you at least an A-, 80% a B-, and so on.


## Coding

This is a Python class, so you'll be coding in Python. Your submissions must run
on Gradescope,  which is running  Python 3.10  in Ubuntu Linux 22.04 containers.
Most code should work unchanged across all recent versions of Python.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assignments:

- You can use anything from the Python standard library.
- Other packages will not be available on Gradescope.


## Piazza

We'll be using Piazza as a Q&A forum. If you have a question that might apply to
other people as well, it's better to ask on Piazza than to send an email.

If you ask coding questions on Piazza, please:

- Post the smallest section of code that fully describes your problem.
- Include any code as a code snippet.  Not a screenshot. Not a cell phone photo.
- In Markdown mode, use triple backticks (`` ``` ``) to format code blocks.
- If you include more than a few lines of your code, make your question private.


## Cheating

All assignments are individual assignments.  Write your own code.  If you decide
to share code, remember that these penalties apply to all parties:

- **First Offense:** Zero on the assignment _and_ final grade lowered by one letter.
- **Second Offense:** Fail the class.

The programming assignments  are involved enough  that it's virtually impossible
for anyone to have the same code as you  by accident.  As long as you write your
own code you have nothing to worry about.

Tests are also individual assignments.  Hopefully this is obvious.  If you cheat
on a test, you fail the class immediately.
